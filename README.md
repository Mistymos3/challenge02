# challenge02

## I was tasked with changing the HTML of a webpage, to figure out what was needed or missing within the code and to fix it as well as to change the semantics.

## I corrected a link, changed the title of the page, added meta name: keywords, description and viewpoint, changed the structure of the page, and changed some semantic elements of the page.

## I am new to HTML and GitHub and was overthinking everything, so this project took a while. My motivation to complete this was knowledge and wanting to learn. I found things within the page code that I wanted to fix but could not due to not knowing enough...I am more motivated now than when I started.
